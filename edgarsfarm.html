                The design of the original website is cluttered, text heavy and has poor information hierarchy, together
                these problems made site navigation difficult. This
                made users hesitant to donate on the website or even use the site itself.

                <p class="text">
                  The Edgarâ€™s Mission website was designed to gain support via donations but through user research, a
                  social media audit and stakeholder interviews I discovered the best way to improve the site would be
                  to <b>redesign focusing on improving customer trust by improving the donations and booking
                    experience</b>

            One of the main takeaways from the user interviews was <b>Edgar's need to create a sense of trust</b>. I
            added additional information regarding where user donations went, a sign of gratitude from the founder as
            wells as improving the donation user experience to something more modern.

            Another important discovery was the lack of a proper booking experience. I created a simple

            After creating this prototype, I submitted to the staff at Edgar's. The overall reaction was resoundingly
            positive. Suprisingly it wasn't the donation and booking redesign that they were drawn to, but the idea of
            creating a website that had a sense of trust. Edgar's is currently redesign their website taking the
            redesign into account.</p>
